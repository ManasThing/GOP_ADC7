Dependency Inversion Principle

In programming, the dependency inversion principle is a way to decouple software modules.
This principle states that:
1: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
2: Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

To comply with this principle, we need to use a design pattern known as a dependency inversion pattern, most often solved by using dependency injection.
Dependency injection is a huge topic and can be as complicated or simple as one might see the need for.
Typically, dependency injection is used simply by ‘injecting’ any dependencies of a class through the class’ constructor as an input parameter.

For example:

class post
{
private ErrorLogger errorLogger = new ErrorLogger();

    void CreatePost(Database db, string postMessage)
    {
        try
        {
            db.Add(postMessage);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            errorLogger.log(ex.ToString())
        }
    }
}

Observe how we create the ErrorLogger instance from within the Post class. Let’s fix this by using dependency injection.

class Post
{
    private Logger _logger;

    public Post(Logger injectedLogger)
    {
        _logger = injectedLogger;
    }

    void CreatePost(Database db, string postMessage)
    {
        try
        {
            db.Add(postMessage);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            logger.log(ex.ToString())
        }
    }
}

By using dependency injection we no longer rely on the Post class to define the specific type of logger.
